# Research Notes  


## Introduction {#intro}

Location: Folder for this R site is in...   
**MBP2015:** `/Users/Marcelo-Rosales/Documents/GitHub_Repos/Rprojects/Experiments/Research_Notebook`  
**MBP2020:**  `/Users/marcelorosales/Documents/GitHub_Repos/Rprojects/Experiments/Research_Notebook`

This is also Bookdown GitHub page, you can found it in [https://marcelorosales.github.io/Research_Notebook/](https://marcelorosales.github.io/Research_Notebook/).  

Each time a new entry is finish: **Save, Rebuild, Commit and Push to update webpage.**  
  
  
## Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```  
   

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro) `(\@ref(intro)` . If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods) `(\@ref(methods)`). To reference chapters use the `\@ref(name of the chapter)`, keep in mind that the **name of the chapter** is the first line `# title` of the .Rmd file. Moreover, the back slash `\` character in the japanese keyboard is made with the keys `Alt/Option + ¥` (¥ is next to the erase/back key). Interestingly `\` works fine in R but does not seems to work for Word or other MS office applications. 

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

# New Mac: Installing and Setup  

**Very Important!!!!**
When opening/starting a new mac for the first time always use the same account name and Home directory name. This will make the running of R code in either machine (folder and file locations) equal, and conflits or modification will be minimal. 

**MBP2015:**  
Account name: Marcelo-Rosales  
Full Name: Marcelo Rosales  
Home directory: /Users/Marcelo-Rosales  
  
**MBP2020:** USE THIS BETTER From nowon!!! (Simpler to fill and set)  
Account name: marcelorosales  
Full Name: Marcelo Rosales  
Home directory: /Users/marcelorosales  
  
****************************************************************************    

## Install Homebrew  
  
> **Why to Install Homebrew?** Homebrew is a `terminal` program that helps to easily Install, Update, Upgrade, and Automate many tasks in Mac computers.   
I used Mainly to migrate all my programs from one machine to another.   

> `Formulae and Cask` are small code snippets that need to be copy/paste or type into Mac Terminal to install a program.  

An example of a "Cask formula":  
```{ruby eval=FALSE}
brew install --cask inkscape
```
You can search for the formulae and cask of a program in the homebrew webpage.

> At the end of the installation, I will make a list of all the essencial programs (and some of the program settings like R and Atom) I need in a computer, and whenever I need to set up a new machine; Then, I will not have to install all the programs one by one again.   

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uvr9-zUB3w.    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VP2NVv3LHg.  

**To Install Homebrew (on macOS or Linux)** <https://brew.sh/>.   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```   
More installation information and options: <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>.
If running Linux or WSL, there are some pre-requisite packages to install.

**To Uninstall Homebrew** link [here](https://github.com/homebrew/install#uninstall-homebrew)  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall.sh)"
```  
Download the uninstall script and run /bin/bash uninstall.sh --help to view more uninstall options.


Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t.  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE}
brew install wget
```  

Update and upgrade, in brief, brew update updates Homebrew itself while brew upgrade will upgrade your Homebrew-installed software to their latest versions.Dec 2020:   

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew update
brew upgrade
```

**In my 2021Y-01M-02D upgrade and update an error occurred.**   
IF Error:   
homebrew-core is a shallow clone.   
To `brew update`, first run:   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
```   
This restriction has been made on GitHub's request because updating shallow
clones is an extremely expensive operation due to the tree layout and traffic of
Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask. We don't do this for you
automatically to avoid repeatedly performing an expensive unshallow operation in
CI systems (which should instead be fixed to not use shallow clones). Sorry for
the inconvenience!   

The run ( requires a long time to run )   

Check if brew installed correctly with:   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew doctor
```   
Usually it prompts **_`Your system is ready to brew.`_**   

In my macbook pro 2015:   
**Warning: Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed formulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin.**
Consider setting the PATH for example like... so run:   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```   
Warning: Your Xcode (11.7) is outdated.  
Please update to Xcode 12.3 (or delete it).   
Xcode can be updated from the App Store.  

**To check if a software/package is installed, and if not, then install**   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew list <formulae1> || brew install <formulae1>
```   
This will error on list and continue with install if not installed otherwise it will just list package files. (one could modify this further as a function or alias in .bashrc to make it easier to type)

From the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU)
To confirm installation and to check install use the command.   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew help
```  
To list all the packages that you can install with homebrew use the command.  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search
```   
A long list will be displayed. If you want to count the number of packages available, 'search' with 'word count' as a list with the command.  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search | wc -l
```   
To search for a specific package use the command, or the brew web page search engine [here]().   
```{}
brew search <name of the package>
```
Example
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search postgres
```
Results can be of two types:   
- Formulae which typically deals with command software and,   
- Cask is and extension of homebrew that allows us to install macOS native applications like google chrome, etc.   

**To install packages with brew, ** first check if the package exist, type the name of the package, ex. `tree` command.  
If the package is not installed the message `bash: tree: command not found` will be displayed. 
To install the package (tree) use the command.
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew install tree
```   
To see the path of the installed package (in this case tree), type in terminal.
```{}
which <pckg name>   ex.
```

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
which tree
```
Terminal will display `/usr/local/bin/tree`, which seem to be the path of the folder where the package was saved, but in reality is a `symbolic link` or `symlink`.  
To see the real location use the commands list and list-out and copy the `symlink` of the packege.   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
ls -la /usr/local/bin/tree
```   
Terminal will display **lrwxr-xr-x  1 Marcelo-Rosales  admin  29 Jan  4 18:04 /usr/local/bin/tree -> ../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree**, where the last portion `../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree` indicates the real location of the package.    

To see more information of the package, like the description, where and when was installed, etc. use the command.
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew info tree
```    
If not installed it will also show the dependencies need for the installation. ex. `brew info node`.   
To uninstall a package.    
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew uninstall tree 
```   
If you want to install GNU packages that are already install natively in and from macOS. It will not over-write over the original, instead it will add a `g` prefix in the name of the new package. 

To see the outdate packages that need an update use the command.
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew outdated
```    
Then `brew update` and `brew upgrade`. However; by default, brew does not remove old version of a package. To remove this outdated version run the command.  
``` {ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew cleanup
```   
**To install applications**, use the command cask, ex.  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew cask install firefox
```   

**_Recently the "cask" command has been modify to "--cask". From now on the command line would be like:_**   

```{ruby, eval=FALSE}
brew install --cask firefox
```

to see info or go directly to the home web page of the application use.   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew info --cask firefox
brew homepage --cask firefox
```   

**To install packages from git repositories,** we can tap the repository and then install the package. This packages Formulae or casks are usually not available in the brew search or web. So;   
1st.: we have to pull the formulae or casks from the git repository with
```{}
brew tap <name of the repository>  
```
Ex.
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew tap heroku/brew
```
2nd.: Search in brew if the formulae or cask were saved.This will pull the Formulae needed to install.
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search heroku
```   
3rd.: If present, then install as normal. 
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew install heroku
```   

****************************************************************************    

## Brew Bundle and the "Brewfile": Tips  

In brew **Install “mas”**, it lets you install and update application from the apple store.   
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew list mas || brew install mas
```  
or
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew install mas
```

**Install the command "brew bundle"**: With this package you can dump all the programs and applications that you installed with brew over time in a "brew file". <https://twit.tv/shows/hands-on-mac/episodes/9>.   

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew bundle
```
or
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew bundle install   
```
[link here](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f)  

At first install (or if never done before) there is no brewfile  and **Error: No Brewfile found**. To create a brew file run:

``` {ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew bundle
```  

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew install bash-completions
```

To see the # of packages available in brew.  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search
```   

To see the list of packages, [word count]- list  
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search | wc -l
``` 

To search a specific package.  

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search [name of package]
```
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew search postgres
```

[Homebrew Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU)  

To install a package:  
```brew install tree```  

To see the path where brew saves the packages:  
`which [name of package]`  
Ex  
```which tree ```  

Output answer in console:  
/usr/local/bin/tree.  

However, this is not the folder, this is just a symbolic link. To see the real location:  
`ls -la [symbolic path]`  
Ex.
```ls -la /usr/local/bin/tree```  
Output answer in console:  
`lrwxr-xr-x  1 marcelorosales  admin  29 Dec 29 20:36 /usr/local/bin/tree -> ../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree`  
This means that the location is in  **/usr/local/Cellar directory.**  
  
For more info on the package, if is not installed it will show and also will show the dependencies it needs.   
`brew info tree`  
  
To uninstall a package  
`brew uninstall tree`  
  
To see the version of packages:  
`grep --version`   

If there is already a native package on the operating system, for instance macOS grep. Then the new package installed will have a “g” prefix.  

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew update
brew outdated
Brew upgrade
brew clean up
brew doctor 
```

To install **Mac applications** use the **“cask”** command.
Example. 

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew cask install firefox 
```

To open the webpages of the application directly from terminal, use
```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
brew home rstudio
brew home r
brew home pycharm
```

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIdiWut8eD8&list=RDCMUCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g&index=5)  
**Homebrew must be installed**. In homebrew,　make sure that git is installed,  also, that your Automated scripts are in your repository.
To check in Terminal run git.
```
git
```   
If it displays git commands, then git is install and ready to connect.

## Customizing Your Terminal: .bash_profile and .bashrc files   
[Link to article](https://youtu.be/vDOVEDl2z84?list=PL-osiE80TeTvGhHkpvfmKWOiIPF8UVy6c).  

You can modify Terminal temporally.  ex. By typing in Terminal. 
```
PS1="Marcelo ->"  
```    
This will change the prompt name to "Marcelo ->", but this is only temporary, once we quit terminal, those changes are lost.   

To customize this preferences permanently we need 2 modify or create 2 `dot files` located in our home directory.  
1. .bash_profile and
2. .bashrc 

This files may or maynot exist in the computer, (In my new computer did not exist neither of these files).
To find these files, go to your home directory. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pwd # (present working directory). If not at home directory, go to /Users/Marcelo-Rosales.  
ls -la # list files and list attribute files (hidden files) or .  
find .bash_profile # to find the .file.   
```  

To clear prior customization, move or delete 2 bash files.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mk  
mv .bash_profile DotFiles/ # this command will move bash files in to a folder named "DotFiles".  
mv .bashrc DotFiles/ 
```



The bash_Profile is used for login shell.
The bashrc file is used for non login shell. 
To create a .bash_profile and a .bashrc file. 
`touch .bash_profile`
`touch .bashrc`
Open with Atom.

# R and Rstudio 

## Rstudio global settings Export/Import. Configurations and settings..  
After Installing R and Rstudio with homebrew, R studio settings are need. Doing it manually takes time and usually all changes are not performed.  

For more information on RStudio [Link to site](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/02/18/rstudio-1-3-preview-configuration/).  
From RStudio 1.3, the settings and configuration were overhaul.  

**User Preferences**  
All the preferences in the Global Options dialog (and a number of other preferences that aren’t) are now saved in a simple, plain-text JSON file named rstudio-prefs.json. Here’s an example:   

```{}
    "posix_terminal_shell": "bash",
    "editor_theme": "Night Owl",
    "wrap_tab_navigation": false
```  


The example above instructs RStudio to use the bash shell for the Terminal tab, to apply the Night Owl theme to the IDE, and to avoid wrapping around when navigating through tabs. All other settings will have their default values.  

By default, this file lives in AppData/Roaming/RStudio on Windows, and **~/.config/rstudio** on other systems. While RStudio writes this file whenever you change a setting, you can also edit it yourself to change settings. You can back it up, or put it in a version control system. You’re in control!  

If you’re editing this file by hand, you’ll probably want a reference. A full list of RStudio’s settings, along with their data types, allowable values, etc., can be found in the [Session User Settings](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/1.3.820-1/session-user-settings.html) section of the RStudio Server Professional Administration Guide.  

$\color{red}{\text{How to get to the file?}}$  
1. If file is hidden by attibute, Unhide all files with `Command-Shift-PERIOD`. (To hide the files again, press the same key shortcut).  
2. Open Terminal> type **`open ~/.config/rstudio`**, this will *open* the a *finder window* showing the folder contaning the file, look for the file **_rstudio-prefs.json_**.  
3. Examine the file and check if preferences correspond to the ones set in R preferences.  
4. Then copy/paste the file in Rstudio of the new machine (save a copy of original file before replacing with old preferences or manually modified the file).  
5. Restart R.  

**Transfer of R global settings successful!!**

## Copy/Transfer the packages installed on one computer or R version to another using Scripts. 

### Method 1: (!THE ONLY METHOD THAT WORKED) USE THIS ONE!!!!!].  
[Link to site](https://gist.github.com/florianhartig/10527319)   
Originally from [here] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1401904/painless-way-to-install-a-new-version-of-r-on-windows)

1. Run on old computer / r version (2015MBP)

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# update, without prompts for permission/clarification
update.packages(ask = FALSE)

# Set working directory
getwd()
setwd() # "/Users/Marcelo-Rosales/Box Sync/Documents/R/Rmarkdown/"
getwd()

# List all packages and save in a file. save() command
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
save(packages, file="Rpackages")
```

2. Run on new computer / r version (2020MBP) txtcol()

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Set working directory
getwd()
setwd() # "/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Documents/R/Rmarkdown"
getwd()

#Load list of packages and install.
load("Rpackages")
for (p in setdiff(packages, installed.packages()[,"Package"]))
  install.packages(p)

Check <- installed.packages()
```

****************************************************************************  

### Method 2:  Quick Way of Installing all your old R libraries on a New Device. DOES NOT WORK!!    
[Link here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/quick-way-of-installing-all-your-old-r-libraries-on-a-new-device/).  To install all the libraries that I had installed in my previous laptop. I did the following:

**Step 1:** Save a list of packages installed in your old computing device (from your old device).  **!Warning** Before saving file make sure you are in the right `working directory` and make sure you KNOW WHERE THE FILE IS STORED.  

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Set working directory where the files will be store. 
 
installed <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
getwd()
setwd("/Users/Marcelo-Rosales/Box Sync/Documents/R/Rmarkdown") # modify folder as needed.
write.csv(installed, 'installed_previously.csv')
```

This saves information on installed packages in a csv file named installed_previously.csv. Now copy or e-mail this file to your new device and access it from your working directory in R.

**Step 2:** Create a list of libraries from your old list that were not already installed when you freshly download R (from your new device).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
installedPreviously <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE) # header = true, to avoid Error bad restore magic number. 
getwd()
setwd("/Users/Marcelo-Rosales/Box Sync/Documents/R/Rmarkdown") # modify folder as needed. 

baseR <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
write.csv(baseR, 'baseR.csv')

toInstall <- setdiff(installedPreviously, baseR)

```

We now have a list of libraries that were installed in your previous computer in addition to the R packages already installed when you download R. So you now go ahead and install these libraries.

**Step 3:** Download this list of libraries.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

install.packages(toInstall)
```

That’s it. Save yourself the trouble installing packages one-by-one all over again.  LIES!!

****************************************************************************  


### Since the code above is not interactive, I modify to suit my needs.**(DOES NOT WORK NEITHER)**  
Since the function choose.dir is only for Windows and not for Mac. I created a custom dir.choose function 

> Run this script in the old computer.  

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(rstudioapi) # Need this package for the prompt windows.

## R Markdown  

### Introduction. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

> When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both **content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks** within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

****************************************************************************  

### Including/Excluding Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

> It is a way to edit text that can be converted in HTML, PDF, Word with the knit function.

1.	Install markdown from CRAN and use.  
2.	See for markdown syntax cheat sheets.  

Here a [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).  
Includes information of Bookdown in chapter 12 and blogdown in chapter 10. 
[R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/).  
[Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

[Themes for R Markdown](https://prettydoc.statr.me/).  
[Using R Markdown Notebook](https://bookdown.org/flavioadsm/untitled2/Untitled2.html#113_interactive_plots).  

Markdown has different options available:  

1. As Document: HTML, PDF, Word.  
1. Presentation: HTML (ioslides), IITML (Slidy), PDF, PowerPoint.  
1. Shiny: Shiny Document, Shiny Presentation.  
1. From Template: Interactive Tutorial, Reprex (lots of features), Reprex (minimal), GitHub Document (Markdown), Package Vignete (HTML).  

**Presentation** in:  

1. HTML (ioslides): HTML presentation viewable with any browser (you can also print ioslides to PDF with Chrome).  
1. IITML (Slidy): HTML presentation viewable with any browser (you can also print Slidy to PDF with 
chrome.).  
1. PDF (Beamer): PDF output requires TeX (MiKTeX on Windows, MacTex 2013+ on OS X, TeX Live 2013+ on Linux).  
1. PowerPoint: PoverPoint previewing requires an istallation of PowerPoint or OpenOffice.  

**Shiny**:  

1. Shiny Document: Can create an HTML document with interactive Shiny components. Shiny Document Test01.Rmd
1. Shiny Presentation: Creates an IOSlides presetntion with interactive shiny components. 

**From Template**:  

1. Interactive Tutorial (learn)   
1. Reprex (lots of features)   
1. Reprex (minimal)  
1. GitHub Document (Markdown)  
1. Package Vignete (HTML)  


************************************************************************************************

### Important Notes for easy typing in Rmarkdown.
Some of the code does not work the same in word_documents as in html_documents.  

> To create a `new line` or `return`, **`insert 2 spaces`** after the point or end of the line.  

Be careful with the characters themselves, these characters (1.) **''** are not the same as these (2.) **``**.  

1. Gives 'word'; _a simple quotation_, the key is next to the return/enter in the English keyboard or in the shift+7 in the japanese keyboard.  
2. Gives `word`; _a format and background style_, the key is in the top left side before 1 in the English key or in the Shift+@ in the Japanese keyboard.   

**Inline R Code**  
It is possible to show r script outcome inline with the text. For example, the line:  
  
There were **_`r nrow(cars)`_** cars studied

was created with the inline code format:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied  
```

**Plain Code Blocks:** Use the three thicks (beging/end) to add plain code blocks, this are displayed in a fixed-width font but not evaluated.  Use the option+command+i shortcut and delete the **{r}** heading to convert code section in plain code.  
```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted  
```
For more help or references on Rmardown styles go to:  
> //Help> Markdown Quidk Reference  

**Color text:** you can use.   

Roses are $\color{red}{\text{beautiful red}}$,
violets are $\color{blue}{\text{lovely blue}}$.  

To add color to text is a little more complicated. 
```{}
Roses are $\color{red}{\text{beautiful red}}$,
violets are $\color{blue}{\text{lovely blue}}$.  
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts 
from <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-markdown-tips-tricks-and-shortcuts/> page.  
Knowing R Markdown keyboard shortcuts will save lots of time when creating reports.  
Here are some of the essential R Markdown shortcuts: **_``_**

|command| on a Mac | on Linux and Windows |
|---:| :---| :---|
To access shortcuts | **_`Option + Shift + K`_** | **_`Alt + Shift + K `_**
Assignment operator <- | **_`Option + -`_**  | **_`Alt + - `_** | 
Pipe operator %>%| **_`Cmd + Shift + M`_** | **_`Ctrl + Shift + M`_** |
Quick `Copy and paste` | **_`Select section + Alt + Command + downArrow`_**
Move word or section up or down | **_`Select section + Alt + Up/Down Arrows`_**
Jump to `Top` or `End` | **_`Command + upArrow`_** or **_`Command + downArrow`_**| 
Write in several lines at the same time | **_`Alt+Command+ L-click lines`_** |   
Wrap text or chunck with characters | **_`Just select text of chunk to be wrapped and type`_** |   
Insert a new code chuck | **_`Command + Option + I`_** | **_`Ctrl + Alt + I`_** |  
Comment/uncomment current line/selection |	**_`⇧⌘C`_** |  **_`Ctrl+Shift+C`_**.|  
Outdent	| **_`Shift+Tab`_** | **_`Shift+Tab`_**　| 　
Knit Document (knitr)	| **_`⇧⌘K`_** | **_`Ctrl+Shift+K`_** |  	
Output in document in the format specified in your YAML header with. **The “k” is short for “knit”!**| **_`Command + Shift + K`_** | **_`Ctrl + Shift + K`_** |  



Next we’ll cover **shortcuts to run code chunks**. But before doing this it is often a good idea to restart your R session and start with a clean environment. 

|command            | on a Mac | on Linux and Windows |
|:---               | :---| :---|
Restart your R session                  | **_`Command + Shift + F10`_** | **_`Ctrl + Shift + F10`_** | 
Run all chunks above the current chunk  | **_`Command + Option + P`_** | **_`Ctrl + Alt + P`_** |  
Run the current chunk                   | **_`Command + Option + C`_** or **_`Command + Shift + Enter`_** | **_`Ctrl + Alt + C`_** or **_`Ctrl + Shift + Enter`_** |  **_``_**
Run the next chunk                      | **_`Command + Option + N`_** | **_`Ctrl + Alt + N`_** |  
Run all chunks                          | **_`Command + Option + R or`_** **_`Command + A + Enter`_** | **_`Ctrl + Alt + R`_** or **_`Ctrl + A + Enter`_**|

[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) can execute code in many languages besides R. Some of the available language engines include:
**_`Code chunks with brackets {} will be run by R while kniting to display results. `_**  

*  R
*  Python
*  SQL
*  Bash
*  Rcpp
*  Stan
*  JavaScript
*  CSS
*  Java
*  Json
*  Ruby

**Code Chunks**  
The R Markdown file below contains three code chunks. You can open it here in RStudio Cloud.  
You can quickly insert chunks like these into your file with the keyboard shortcut  
**Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)**,   
the Add Chunk  command in the editor toolbar  
or by typing the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ```.  


****************************************************************************    

### TO PREVENT CODE RUNNING
> **Seems like it is better to use R notebook instead of R markdown.**

>  **_When you render your .Rmd file, R Markdown will partially run each code chunk and embed the results beneath the code chunk in your final report._**  

>  **_In Rmarkdown: TO PREVENT CODE RUNNING, ERASE CODE BRACKES AND CODE TYPE, USE ONLY ``._**  

If you don't want any code chunks to run you can add `eval = FALSE` in your setup chunk with knitr::opts_chunk$set().

``{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
``
Ex. As shown graphs above. 
```{r cars2, eval = FALSE} 
summary(cars)
```
> Code shown but summary table not shown.  

A better way to do it is to add in the code@s chunk header the opptions:  
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE
```   

****************************************************************************  

### Plots and Interactive plots.

Embed plots, for example can be stopped by eval = FALSE:  
Code for the graphic is here but it is not shown.

```{r pressure3, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
> Code nor plot shown

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was `added` to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  

!Comment: while trying the "eval" command, this error happen...

```
!Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src) : duplicate label 'setup' or 

Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src, markdown_mode) : 
  Duplicate chunk label 'cars', which has been used for the chunk:
summary(cars)
```   
>  **Solution** Change the "name of the code chunk": {r cars} to {r cars1.}  

**Chunk Options**  
Chunk output can be customized with [knitr options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/), arguments set in the {} of a chunk header. Above, we use five arguments:

*  **include = FALSE** prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
*  **echo = FALSE** prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
*  **message = FALSE** prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
*  **warning = FALSE** prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
*  **fig.cap = "..."** adds a caption to graphical results.  

See the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.165887543.809923720.1609919756-125756219.1609328321) for a complete list of knitr chunk options.

## R Notebook

[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results **appear beneath the code**. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

> When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

A way to organize the Markdown text in section with the ability to preview the text without the need of knitting.  
1.	File> New file> Notebook.  
2.	To preview R Notebook, you have to save the file.   
3.	Once you saved the file, the preview will be available in the Viewer.  
4.	In the Meta-data leave the output as html_notebook.  
5.	And then start coding.   


****************************************************************************  

## What is the difference between a Notebook and an R Markdown file?
Most people use the terms R Notebook and R Markdown interchangeably and that is fine. Technically, R Markdown is a file, whereas R Notebook is a way to work with R Markdown files. R Notebooks do not have their own file format, they all use `.Rmd`. All R Notebooks can be `‘knitted’` to R Markdown outputs, and all R Markdown documents can be interfaced as a Notebook.  

An important difference is in the execution of code. **In R Markdown**, when the file is **Knit**, **`all the elements (chunks) are also run`**. Knit is to R Markdown what Source is to an R script (Source was introduced in Chapter 1, essentially it means ‘Run all lines’).  

**In a Notebook**, when the file is rendered with the Preview button, **`no code is re-run, only that which has already been run and is present in the document is included in the output`**.  

Also, **in the Notebook** behind-the-scenes file `(.nb)`, **all the code is always included. Something to watch out for if your code contains sensitive information, such as a password (which it never should!)**.  

****************************************************************************  

## R Bookdown.
A way to manage several Rmad files and compile them in a gitbook style, with the possibility of multiple types of outputs, with support of figure/table number crossreference and can embed interactive content like HTML widgets/Shyny apps (if output is not html, take screenshots automatically) and compile as a gitbook.

Bookdown also can be uploaded to github where other collaborators can proof read and commit changes if nessesary.

**DEMO for Authoring Books with R Markdown.** 

1. Download the GitHub repository https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo as a Zip file, then unzip it locally.

2. Install the RStudio IDE. Note that you need a version higher than 1.0.0. Please download the latest version if your RStudio version is lower than 1.0.0.

3. Install the R package bookdown:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# stable version on CRAN
install.packages("bookdown")
# or development version on GitHub
# devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')

```

4. Open the bookdown-demo repository you downloaded in RStudio by clicking bookdown-demo.Rproj.

5. Open the R Markdown file index.Rmd and click the button Build Book on the Build tab of RStudio.


****************************************************************************    

### Get started with bookdown
The easiest way for beginners to get started with writing a book with R Markdown and bookdown is through the demo bookdown-demo on GitHub:

1. Download the GitHub repository https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo as a Zip file, then unzip it locally.
2. Install the RStudio IDE. Note that you need a version higher than 1.0.0. Please download the latest version if your RStudio version is lower than 1.0.0.
3. Install the R package bookdown: 
  - stable version on CRAN
```
install.packages("bookdown")
```
  - or development version on GitHub  
`devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')`  
    a. Here, If you have other windows or projects running, in the right-upper corner of Rstudio main menu, there is  a **Project** dropdown menu.    
    b. Select **Open project in New session**.   
    c. A new Rstudio window will open ...[ ]...
4. Open the bookdown-demo repository you downloaded with RStudio by clicking bookdown-demo.Rproj.  (Or through the Files Pane)  
5. Open the R Markdown file index.Rmd and click the button Build Book on the Build tab of RStudio.  

`You can check the demo **A Minimal Book Example** in one window while still been able to work in the previews files or projects.`   

> **IMPORTANT!!: FOR ALL THE CHUNCK CODES ALWAYS USE:**  This will show the code but do not run it.  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE
```

Also for **"Helper Functions to Manage TinyTeX, and Compile LaTeX Documents"** go to [The R package tinytex/bookdown degging shoot](https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging)  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')  
```
> Update all your R and LaTeX packages:  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
tinytex::tlmgr_update()
```

### R Bookdown tutorial quick start. (Latest update)

1. **FIle > New project > ...[]... > New Directory > Book Project using bookdown > Directory naem: -> Create project as subdirectory of: -> Browse ~/Documents/GitHub_Repos > √Open in new session ... Create Project.**.  
1. This will create all the files (.yml, book.bib, .Rproj, .text, .css, .Rmd, , including the "Index.Rmd which is the "initialization file" for the HTML book page.  8 file + 6 .Rmd).  
1. Readme.md, _bookdown.yml, _output.yml and index.Rmd will automatically open.   
1. In the **_bookdown.yml** file.  
    a. Add `output_dir: "docs"` to create the docs folder for GitHub Pages. 
1. In the _output.yml.   
    a. Make sure the that the output is set to:   **bookdown::gitbook** (the first line of the file).   
    a. Additional outputs are set (pdf_book and epub_book). This automatically create this 2 formats as well as the HTML format. However; many times, this 2 outputs create conflicts in the building of the book, therefore I recommend to erase these formats unless they are need. In other words*:  
**Erase the section:**  
```{ , eval=FALSE }
bookdown::pdf_book:
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
  latex_engine: xelatex
  citation_package: natbib
  keep_tex: yes
bookdown::epub_book: default
```     
    a. Change the title of the Book "before" and "after" names.  In the sections ` <li><a href="./">A Minimal Book Example</a></li>` to the name of the project, and in after, to any name you want.  
    a. Save file.      
1. In the **index.Rmd** file, make sure that in the YAML header:  
    a. Site: **”bookdown::bookdown_site”**  
    a. Title: (change title).  
    a. author: (change author).  
    a. date: Change to: **"Created: 2021/02/02, Latest update `r Sys.Date()`"**.   
    a. description: (change description)  
    a. Save file.  
1. In **Tools> Project Options …[ ]… > Build tools>**, make sure that it is set to: **website..**.  
1. Since the project already started as a bookdown, the "build" tab will already be displayed in the Environment Panel.  (See below if not).  
1. Press the **Build tab > Build book > bookdown::gitbook** to create the bookdown page.  (All Formats will create all the formats pdf and epub if available).  
1. A new **docs** folders will be automatically created with all the html file needed for the web page. (**_book** and _bookdown_files folders are also created).   
1. You can use the **Knit** button to preview the files.   
1. Close the project, after configuration in GitHub app and GitHubPages, open again and project will display the **Git Tab** in the environment panel.    

#### To create the website in gitHub Pages.   

Go to the GitHub desktop app.  
1. Go to the Repository List screen. (click in the down arrow next to **Current Repository**).  
1. Click on **Add** (next to the Filter box).  
1. Add > Add Existing Repository > ...[]... Add local Repository > choose (Choose containing folder) > Open > ...[]...  
1. **Message* `This directory does not appear to be a Git repository. Would you like to create a repository here instead?`   
1. Click in **Create a repository** > ...[]... Create a New Repository > ç Create Repository.  
1. GitHub will create the repository in the app. 
1. ç Publish Repository > ...[]... **Un-check** `keep this code private` > ç Publish Repository.  

Go to GitHub.com page (browser).   
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/).  
1. In the repository list select the repsitory created.  
1. MarceloRosales/Repo Name > Settings > GitHub Pages > Source > √ main > selected forlder: /docs > Save.  
1. Your site is ready to be published at https://~.github.io/~/.  
1. Close/Open Project(Repository) in RStudio and the **Git** tab will be displayed and available


****************************************************************************    

### R Bookdown tutorial quick start. (If not created as Bookdown)

1. **File> New project> New directory> Empty project… [ ]…** Directory name> choose location (subdirectory of…)
2. Once project is created, open a new R Markdown file: **File> New File> R Markdown> Title of the book> Author > √HTML> OK**  
3. Save the new R Markdown document as **”index”**. File will be saved as index.Rmd
4. Then in YAML header set:
    a. Output: **”bookdown::gitbook”**
    b. Site: **”bookdown::bookdown_site”**
    c. Save
5. **Tools> Project Options …[ ]… > Build tools> set to: website..**
6. Restart R project so R can recognize file as a book.
7. Once is restart, a **build** tab will be available in the Environment Panel.  
8. [Build]> Build Book> … A gitbook will be created. 
9. The index.rmd is the first chapter of the book.
10. To add another chapter create a new> R Markdown file> name chapter title. Ex. Chapter02
11. Then erase YAML and start with the chapter title with **one single hash** tag. Ex. # Hello World!
12. Rebuilt the book [Build]> Build Book> and the new chapter will be added. 

To reference figures displayed by r code. In the fig code, place a name to the code chunck. Example 
```
{r fig-name, fig.cap=’This is the figures caption and you can set the width, aspect, and align’, out.width=’80%’, fig.asp=.75, fig.align=’center’}
R code for figure
```
Then, reference the figure by its code chunk label with the **`fig:`** prefix, example.   
```
See figure \@ref(fig:fig-name).  
```
†(In the Japanese keyboard option+¥ next to the backspace to make the backslash＼, but if Backslash is not set, go to **symbol System preferences> keyboard> Input Sources> '¥' key generates: Backslash.** In word the ¥ key output is still ¥ but in Rstudio is \.

Hosting bookdown in github - Outline  
Some packages may be required.  

> library(gh)  

- Create bookdown in r in a “repository” folder.
- Add repository through github desktop.
- Close r bookdown and open again, (the git tab will appear)
- Add/Erase portions in the .yml files, build book and commit through R.
- Edit settings in github browser to show the web page from “docs” folder.

This method is a mix of other references but ultimately my experience to publish my bookdown to GitHub pages. 

1. In RStudio, create a **new bookdown project** (in a new session) from template in a **"repository"** folder.
    * // Session > New Session
    * // New Project > New Directory > Book project using bookdown.  
    * Choose Directory Name.  
    * Choose the directory/folder to place the book project under. ( Do not use Box or Dropbox or Google Drive or any other cloud storage since RStudio is constantly creating and erasing file that could lead to conflicts when commiting a pushing.)  The page will be saved in GitHub and version control will manage the updates in the folders/files. This is convinient, since all procedures will be made locally in the computer but committed and pushed to all computers/collaborator through Git.
    * A new book project will be created. All the files needed for bookdown web-page are automatically created.  
    
1. Add the newly created **repository** folder to [my GitHub account](https://github.com/MarceloRosales/). Using the **GitHub Desktop app.**  
    * Click on **Current Repository**  
    * Click on **Add**.   
    * Choose **Add existing repository**.  This will Upload the repository created in the local folder to the GitHub account.   
    * **Add local repository** path and click on **Add Repository**.  
    * Some time will not recognize folder as repository. Click on **create repository(?)**
    * **Commit**  by selection all files and filling the **Summary** box (*required*) and **Push** to GitHub.
1.　The **Git** tab: At this point there is no **Git** Tab in the environment Pane. Save the files in RStudio, and reopen the project and the *Git tab* in environment and **Git button** in main menu will be displayed.  
1. Open the **_bookdown.yml** file and add `output_dir: "docs"` in a line.  
1. Open the **_output.yml** file and erase this section from the file.  
```
bookdown::pdf_book:
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
  latex_engine: xelatex
  citation_package: natbib
  keep_tex: yes
bookdown::epub_book: default
```  

This section creates a pdf and a e-pub files, but they constantly have problems building therefore is better to avoid them until needed.  

5. **Build** the book buy clicking in //environment > Build > Build Book >   
1. Check for Warning or errors in red, a successful creation should say `Output created: docs/index.html`, a new folder **docs** will be created containing all the html files for the page.   
1. In //Environment > Git > Select all the files (cmmd + A) and check all files. Click on **commit**, place the commit comment and click **commit**.  
1. **Push** all the files to GitHub.  

****************************************************************************  

### To Publish the GitHub Page.  

1. Go to the [my GitHub account](https://github.com/MarceloRosales/)  
1. In **Repositories**, choose the repository project created.  
1. Go to **Settings** of the repository, scroll down to **GitHub**.  
1. In **source** select branch: **main** and folder: **/docs**, then **Save**.  
1. A new web address where the page is been hosted will be displayed.

### Other method for Bookdown and GitHub Pages:   

**THESE METHODs PROVED TO BE MORE COMPLICATED, BUT ARE PLACE HERE AS REFERENCE. FOR A SIMPLER VERSION SEE GITHUB.**  

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmYvbQkhs)

****************************************************************************  

#### Method 1. Existing project, GitHub first  
[Source; Happy Git and GitHub for the use R](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html)  

A novice-friendly workflow for bringing an existing R project into the RStudio and Git/GitHub universe.  
Probably your existing R project isolated in a directory on your computer. If that’s not already true, make it so.  
Create a directory and marshal all the existing data and R scripts there. It doesn’t really matter where you do this, but note where the project currently lives.  

1. Make a repo on GitHub. Go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in.  

    Click the green “New repository” button.  
    Public  
    YES Initialize this repository with a README.  
    Click the big green button “Create repository.”  
    Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button. Or copy the SSH URL if you chose to set up SSH keys.  
1. Create a New RStudio Project via git clone  

    In RStudio, start a new Project:  
    File > New Project > Version Control > Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository.   
    Suggest: “Open in new session”.  
    Click “Create Project” to create a new directory, which will be all of these things:  
        a directory or “folder” on your computer  
        a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository  
        an RStudio Project  
    This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file.
1. Bring your existing project over  

    Using your favorite method of moving or copying files, copy the files that constitute your existing project into the directory for this new project.  
    In RStudio, consult the Git pane and the file browser. Are you seeing all the files? They should be here if your move/copy was successful.    
1. Stage and commit  
1. Push your local changes to GitHub  

****************************************************************************    

#### Method 2. Book down and GitHub Pages.     

[Source:](https://youtu.be/RdSmYvbQkhs).  

1. In RStudio, create a **new bookdown project** (in a new session) from template.  
    * // Session > New Session  
    * // New Project > New Directory > Book project using bookdown.  
    * Choose Directory Name.  
    * Choose the directory/folder to place the book project under. ( Do not use Box or Dropbox or Google Drive or any other cloud storage.  The page will be saved in GitHub and version control will manage the updates in the folders/files. This is convinient, since all procedures will be made locally in the computer but commited and pushed to all computers/collaborator throught Git.)  
    * A new book project will be created. All the files needed for bookdown webpage are automatically created.   
1. To Upload a bookdown to GitHub go to Terminal in Rstudio.  
 * In terminal See 'git --help'.  
 * You can type:  
 
```{ruby eval=FALSE}
git  # to see if  package is installed or not)
git –version # To the git version installed. 
git init  # Initialized empty Git repository in
git add . # add all
git commit -m”Add text file in case” # To add the comment in the commit. 
```  
   
> library(gh)  
> library(gitcreds)  
  
Version Control with Git and SVN.   (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=1.4.1103&mode=desktop )  
Setup for git in r https://r-pkgs.org/git.html.  
From R, you can check if you already have an SSH key-pair by running:  
  
`file.exists("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")`  
  
Copy  
If that returns FALSE, you’ll need to create a new key. You can either follow the instructions on GitHub or use RStudio. Go to RStudio’s global options, choose the Git/SVN panel, and click “Create RSA key…”:  

In _output.yml erase 
bookdown::pdf_book:
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
  latex_engine: xelatex
  citation_package: natbib
  keep_tex: yes
bookdown::epub_book: default

In _bookdown.ylm add
output_dir: "docs"  


****************************************************************************    


### Bookdown Trouble shooting.  

While installing R bookdown, there were several problems. To solve the problem:  

1. Re-install all R packages from the package list of my 2015 MBP. (See 12.0.5 Script to copy the packages installed on one computer or R version to another).  
1. Then update all packages with Update all your R and LaTeX packages command: (from 14.0.4)  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
tinytex::tlmgr_update()
```  
1. Some error referred to the citr package and Latex. citr is the R zotero bibliography pack (see 14.0.7),  
1. When building the page `Make sure that the output is "bookdown::gitbook" and not in "All formats". `  
1. Other problem is the code chunks, RStudio will run all the code in the page unless specified otherwise. Therefore,  **_Always use the `{r  eval=FALSE}` at the beginning of the chunk code_**  (echo=TRUE is the default setting, no need to type in)
1. Devtools packages did not installed correctly. **Error: installation of package ‘devtools’ had non-zero exit status**.  

To solve this problem:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# 1st. try to Install devtools.
install.packages("devtools")
```
If devtools can not be installed. 
Install in terminal: 
```{}
brew install libgit2
```

Then in R devtools and usethis packages.
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("usethis")
```

Other packages that might be needed...
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cli")
install.packages("stringi")
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("gert")
install.packages("git2r")
install.packages('usethis')
```

## R and zotero for bibliography.   

[Guide/tutorial on using zotero in r](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/73390/guide-or-tutorial-on-using-zotero-in-r)   

Install the BetterBibTeX plugin **in** Zotero and then use the **citr** package in R.   
See here for General instructions on adding citations to an R Markdown document (though citr makes this easier):   
[Link here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)  

[Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).  

* Highly [customized exports](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/).  
* Fixes date field exports: export dates like ‘forthcoming’ as ‘forthcoming’ instead of empty, but normalize valid dates to unambiguous international format.  
* [Auto export](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/auto/) of collections or entire libraries when they change.  
* [Pull export](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pull/) from the embedded webserver.  
* Automatic [journal abbreviation](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/).  

****************************************************************************    

### **Start here:  Zotero for R INSTALLATION**  
[Installation instruction](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)  

1. Download the [latest release of zotero better bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest ), make sure to save the XPI file, then in Zotero:  
1. Open Zotero (standalone)  
1. In the main menu go to Tools > Add-ons  
1. Select ‘Extensions’  
1. Click on the gear in the top-right corner and choose ‘Install Add-on From File…’  
1. Choose .xpi that you’ve just downloaded, click ‘Install’  
1. Restart Zotero  

_Note: the default setting of BBT will generate different citekeys that Zotero would itself generate; the keys from Zotero are not always safe for use in bibtex/biber. If you want to get the stock zotero keys, set the pattern in the preferences to [zotero]. I very much recommend **not** choosing [zotero] as your pattern unless you have existing articles that use keys generated by previous Zotero-native BibTeX export._  


**Once Zotero re-starts, set Configuration:**
A welcome to better BibTex for Zotero will appear.  
Select:  
 √ Use the BBT default format > Continue.  
 √ Enable darg-and-drop citations > Continue.  
 √ Unabbreviate journal names on import > Continue.  
 √ Expand @string journal names on imports > Continue.  
All done.

****************************************************************************    

### For Zotero-R to work properly.  

Open to Zotero Preferences>  

**To quick copy/paste form Zotero to Rstudio (command+ Shift +C).** Set Config to Pandoc.  
1. Zotero Preferences> **Better BibTex**> Citation keys>  
    a. Citation key format: [auth:lower][year]  
    b. Keep keys unique: √ Across all libraries.  
    c. Quick copy/drag and drop citations> QuickCopy format:  √ **Pandoc** √ Surround Pandoc citations with brackets.   
2. After that for easy export to Rstudio and Markdown, Go to:   
    Zotero Preferences> **Export**> Default Format: **Better BibTex Quick Copy** √   

In Zotero> preferences> Better BibTex> Citation keys:  

Default settings:  
Citation key format: [auth:lower][year]
QuickCopy Format: LaTex  
LaTex command: cite for **\cite{acar2015}**  

Change to:  
QuickCopy Format: Pandoc for [@acar2015]  
√ Surround Pandoc citations with brackets.  

Other Citation key format options:
[auth:lower][shorttitle3_3][year]: ?  
[zotero]: almeida_structural_2011  
[zotero:clean]  
[auth:lower][year]: alford2015  . IF duplicated alford2015a  

Then I changed to [auth:lower][year][month]

### To add Refereces/Bibliography to R bookdown. 

Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/GAVXVkcpbG0) as guide:   

**Steps**  

1. Add the refences in the Markdown text with the quickcopy feature set above as in normal text. I advice to place all the related refecences in one folder in zotero, it doesnt matter if you don't use all the reference at the end.  ex.  
`
[@almehmadi_vwc2_2018], [@rosales_rocabado_multi-factorial_2018].   
`
1. In Zotero (standalone), select all the references you want to add. 
1. Zotero// File> Export library.  
1. Select Format: √ Better BibLaTex.  
1. Check √ Keep update if you need to modify the bibliography in zotero, otherwhise is not necessary.  
1. Click ok/  
1. Choose the namefile.bib and save **inside the Bookdown Projects folder**.   
1. Chose Better BibLaTex and click Save.  
1. In the index.Rdm YAML (Meta-data), add the name of the .bib file saved.  **bibliography: [book.bib, namefile.bib,]**  
1. Reference will be displayed at the end of the chapter **after building the book**.  
1. To add an overall reference, **Create a Reference.Rmd file** and knit all references by typing the following code.   
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
`r if (knitr:::is_html_output()) '
# References {-}
'`
```  
1. Finally build the book and References will be created.  

Here example of the meta-data YAML of Bookdown.   

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
-- 
title: "A Minimal Book Example"
author: "Yihui Xie"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
output: bookdown::gitbook
documentclass: book
bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib, myLibrarytest01.bib, Exported Items.bib]
biblio-style: apalike
link-citations: yes
github-repo: rstudio/bookdown-demo
description: "This is a minimal example of using the bookdown package to write a book. The output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook."
---
```
****************************************************************************    

### To automatically create a bib database for R packages
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

****************************************************************************    

### Example from the "Introduction" file in bookdown.  

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter `\@ref(intro)`. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter `\@ref(methods)`.

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig-03, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab03, tidy=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

## Blogdown.  

[Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).  
[Best R Hugo Blogdown Site End to End Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9Jqvaoeh1W4?list=PLuak_bGvcWZNu-Eu2MPBS7gZ6Zz3jdc4w) Use this video as a guide.  
[Live-Tutorial Making Live Site, Blogdown Hugo GitHub Netlify](https://youtu.be/fq_AYx874gs) Error at the end and did not deploy the site.  
[Video01](https://youtu.be/oXFPOOrkogA?list=PLuak_bGvcWZNu-Eu2MPBS7gZ6Zz3jdc4w).  


1. Installs in Rstudio
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Install from CRAN
install.packages('blogdown') 

## Or, install from GitHub
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')

# Install devtools for git and github
install.packages("devtools")
```

1. Since blogdown is based on the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), you also need to install Hugo. 
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```  
    While installing Hugo, check which Hugo version is been downloading.  
    
1. Git and Github are also necessary. Install both.  

    **Git**  
    In git it is important that the **"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"** is check. Actually it is the default setting so... not really necessary to do anything.  
    
    **In Github**   
    Signup/Login to github  
    https://github.com/login  
    MarceloRosales  
```{eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
pw:mrcd3
```
    mail:@hotmail.com  
    
    In github create a new repository. (you can do it in terminal as well is much faster)  
    
    MarceloRosales/Blogdowntest01  
    add a Readme file.   
    Create repository  
    
    Once created, click in **Code** green button, and copy the "Clone" https URL link.   
    https://github.com/MarceloRosales/Blogdowntest01.git  

1. Once All installed is recomended to re-start Rstudio.  

1. Next Create a New Project> Version Control> Git>  **Paste github URL to repository** and **assign a sub-folder to keep all site under the **"R Blogdown"** sub-directory. ( *browse*> ~Box/.../R Blogdown, R creates directly the folder name with the name of the repository)    
    †If Rstudio is alread open and dont want to close the current windows/session, in the upper left corner of menu, select **"Open project in new session"**   
    
1. Once the project is created, a new **Git** tab will be available in the Environment tab.  
1. Go to the Hugo [Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and choose a theme.(Check is maintained or actively updated)  
1. For this example I choose **Airspace**, Minimal, Health Science Journal. (Some theme require pay for extra features.)  
1. CLick in Home page or download. This will redirect to the github repository  
1. Copy the repository name: **themefisher/airspace-hugo**. (not the adress https://github.com/themefisher/airspace-hugo.)      
1. In R create a new site with: **†WARNING: Run this code in the blogdown project CONSOLE?, if run in other folder it may override files.**   
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "themefisher/airspace-hugo")
```  
1. All the files required will be created, and a preview of the site will be available.  
1. In the console panel check for the virtula IP address or virtual host. ex, **Serving the directory . at http://localhost:4321**   
1. Copy **http://localhost:4321** paste in the browser and it should work as a webpage. The site is generated by R, so it is not deployed or uploaded to github.  
1. **WARNING**: now that files are created. **DO NOT** change of replace the **public** folder.   
1. In console; info and commands to start stop server are written.  
    ― The new site is ready  
    ○ To start a local preview: use blogdown::serve_site(), or the RStudio add-in "Serve Site"  
    ○ To stop a local preview: use blogdown::stop_server(), or restart your R session  
1. Next Stop the local server. To stop it, call `blogdown::stop_server()` in console or restart the R session. (in the video `servr::daemon_stop(1)`)    
    ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    blogdown::stop_server()
    ```   
1. Stage all files to github, for this use // Tools>Shell, seems like works better than Terminal.   
1. In terminal set git user name: `git config --global user.name "MarceloRosales"`   
1. In terminal set git user mail: `git config --global user.email "selasorolecram@hotmail.com"`   
1. Stage all files: `git add -A`  
1. Then in R Environment> Git> Commit ...[]..., To **Commit all files**.  
1. In Commit message type a description of the commint. ex. **First commit**.   
1. Once all is committed,  press close. 
1. Then, click **Push** in the same window.    
1. **An error** occurred... remote: error: GH007: Your push would publish a private email address. To solve:   
    1. Go to Setting your commit email address.  
    1. Follow the Setting your email address for every repository on your computer.
    1. Open your GitHub account, and go to Settings → Emails.
    1. Select the Keep my email address private check box.
    1. **Unselect** the Block command line pushes that expose my email check box.
1. Then, click **Push** in the same window again.  **Push successfull**.

###  How to modify site in Rstudio


********************************************************************************

## **Useful Tips.**   

### Math Formula inputs.  
In the UI menu // n Add-ins menu, there is the Input LaTeX Math. Write the math formula and a latex source will be generated.

For example*.  
a\ +\ ß\ =\ \sum_{i=1}^nX_i.   

Then add $ at the beginning and the end of the equation and formula will be display as a professional math formula in the preview.  

$x^2 + y^2$  

$a\ +\ ß\ =\ \sum_{i=1}^nX_i$  

****************************************************************************  

### Displaying Code and Plosts

* **_Always use the `{r  eval=FALSE}` at the beginning of the chunk code_** to stop RStudio automatic run.  
* To have a better control on how to display the code chunks and plots, use the **chunk Preferences**. It appears in the Editor panel when `{r}` or other code type is at the head of the code chunk.  
* Click on the gear icon and several option will be available.   

****************************************************************************  

### How to add/embed videos and images.  

**Videos**  
To [embed videos in markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/learnr-videos.html).  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
![](https://youtu.be/GAVXVkcpbG0){width="100" height="100"}.  
```
OR:
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/GAVXVkcpbG0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  
```
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://youtu.be/GAVXVkcpbG0")
```  

**Images**  
To add a pictures, use:   
[source 01](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25166624/insert-picture-table-in-r-markdown).  

`![Caption for the picture.](/path/to/image.png)`  

But this do not offer the ability to adjust the image to fit the page (see Update, below). To adjust the image properties (size, resolution, colors, border, etc), you'll need some form of image editor. I find I can do everything I need with one of ImageMagick, GIMP, or InkScape, all free and open source.

Update:  
Pandoc incorporated "link_attributes" for images. "Resizing images" can be done directly. For example:  
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
![unchanged image](foo.jpg)
![much-smaller image](foo.jpg){#id .class width=30 height=20px}
![half-size image](foo.jpg){#id .class width=50% height=50%}
```

The bookdown book does a great job of explaining that the best way to include images is by using `include_graphics()'. For example, a full width image can be printed with a caption below:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp.png")
```
The reason this method is better than the pandoc approach `![your image](path/to/image)` is because:
- It automatically changes the command based on the output format (HTML/PDF/Word)
- The same syntax can be used to the size of the plot (`fig.width`), the output width in the report (`out.width`), add captions (`fig.cap`) etc.
- It uses the best graphical devices for the output. This means PDF images remain high resolution.

### How to check Differences between rmarkdown files  

The `diff_rmd` function can be used to produce a nicely-formatted document showing the differences between two rmarkdown files. This function can be used to compare two files, or a file with previous versions of itself (within a git repository). See [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/reviewer/index.html#differences-between-rmarkdown-files) for more info.  

You can install the development version of `reviewer` from [GitHub](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/reviewer) with:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/reviewer")
```  

See the [package vignette](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/reviewer/articles/reviewer.html) for a demonstration.  

The `diff_rmd` function can be used to produce a nicely-formatted document showing the differences between two rmarkdown files. For the purposes of demonstration, we’ll use the example files bundled with the package. We’ll compare modified_file to its earlier version.   

Reference_file:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
modified_file <- system.file("extdata/CheatSheet-modified.Rmd", package = "reviewer")
reference_file <- system.file("extdata/CheatSheet.Rmd", package = "reviewer")
```

Compare:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(reviewer)
result <- diff_rmd(modified_file, reference_file)
```

And our output:

**We can also compare the current version of a document to a previous version in stored in a git repository.**   

If a `reference_file` argument is not provided, by default the modified_file will be compared to the most recent copy in the git repo:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
result <- diff_rmd(modified_file)
```

**Or we can compare it to how it appeared in the git repository after a particular commit**   (here, the commit with reference 750ab4):  

```{r eval=FALSE}
result <- diff_rmd(reference_file, "750ab4")
```

# R Methods and how "to\`s":

## How to add Lorem ipsum paragraphs in r markdow.

**lorem::ipsum()** link [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/lorem) to see all examples.\
\* Quickly generate lorem ipsum placeholder text with **lorem::ipsum()**.\
\* Easy to integrate in RMarkdown documents.\
\* Includes an RStudio addin to insert lorem ipsum into the current document.

First install

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/lorem")

# If devtools can not be installed. 
# Install in terminal: 
# brew install libgit2

#Then in R
# install.packages("devtools")
# install.packages("usethis")

```

**Usage**: The addin allows you to specify the number of desired paragraphs and sentences.

R Markdown\
**Call lorem::ipsum() in an inline R chunk in R Markdown.**

```{r eval=FALSE}
`r lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 2)`  
```

**Place the scrip with "\`\`" (inline code) to call the function. ex.**

```{r eval=FALSE}
`r lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 1)`  
```

**You can control the number of paragraphs and sentences per paragraph.**

```{r eval=FALSE}
`r lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(1, 2, 3))`  
```

You can also adjust the avg_words_per_sentence to create long or short paragraphs.

```{r eval=FALSE}
`r lorem::ipsum(2, avg_words_per_sentence = 3)`  
`r lorem::ipsum(1, avg_words_per_sentence = 20)`  
```

**Everywhere Else**\
Generate lorem ipsum anywhere else using lorem::ipsum() or lorem::ipsum_words().

```{r eval=FALSE}
ipsum_items <- replicate(5, lorem::ipsum_words(5))
cat(paste("-", ipsum_items), sep = "\n")
```

## How to insert colummns in r markdown.

Description of the methods in this [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31753897/2-column-section-in-r-markdown).

Put the following in the **css file or directly in rmarkdown.**

> **It is better to add directly to the style.css file for it to work properly.**

```{css }
<style>
  .col2 {
    columns: 2 200px;         /* number of columns and width in pixels*/
    -webkit-columns: 2 200px; /* chrome, safari */
    -moz-columns: 2 200px;    /* firefox */
  }
  .col3 {
    columns: 3 100px;
    -webkit-columns: 3 100px;
    -moz-columns: 3 100px;
  }
</style>
```

### 3 Columns + loremipsum example

Code:

```{ruby, eval=FALSE }
<div class="col3">
**1. paragraphs = 1**   
`r lorem::ipsum()`  
**2. paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(1, 2, 3)**    
`r lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(1, 2, 3))`  
**3. paragraphs = 2, avg_words_per_sentence = 3**     
`r lorem::ipsum(2, avg_words_per_sentence = 3)`  
**4.** four.    
**5.** five.      
**6.** six.      
**7.** seven.     
**8.** eight.    
**9.** nine.     
</div>
```

Result

::: {.col3}
**1. paragraphs = 1**\
`r lorem::ipsum()`\
**2. paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(1, 2, 3)**\
`r lorem::ipsum(paragraphs = 3, sentences = c(1, 2, 3))`\
**3. paragraphs = 2, avg_words_per_sentence = 3**\
`r lorem::ipsum(2, avg_words_per_sentence = 3)`\
**4.** four.\
**5.** five.\
**6.** six.\
**7.** seven.\
**8.** eight.\
**9.** nine.
:::

### 2 Columns examples.

Code: (Erase the "()" in the {} section, it should be **{r}** only)

```{ruby, eval=FALSE}
<div class="col2">  
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)```  
</div>
```

Result:

::: {.col2}
```{r}
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)
```
:::

From here the columns are released.

## How to Find the indices of lines in Markdown that are prose (not balanced).

[Link1](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xfun/xfun.pdf), [Link2](https://rdrr.io/cran/xfun/man/prose_index.html)

**Prose_index** Find the indices of lines in Markdown that are prose (not code blocks).

**Description**\
Filters out the indices of lines between code block fences such as \`\`\` (could be three or four or more backticks).

**Usage**

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(xfun)
## ??xfun
prose_index("```", warn = TRUE)
prose_index(c("a", "```", "b", "```", "c"))
prose_index(c("a", "````", "```r", "1+1", "```", "````", "c"))

```

**Value:** An integer vector of indices of lines that are prose in Markdown. **Note:** If the code fences are not balanced (e.g., a starting fence without an ending fence), this function will treat all lines as prose.

Still DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS AND WHAT THE OUTCOME MEANS.

## How to DISCHARGE git commits to avoid conflicts (Special circumstances).

Apparently it is not possible to discard changes made in \>environment \>Git tab. (At least I did not found a way yet).

The only way Discard is by:

1.  going to the **GitHub desktop app**,\
2.  Select the correct repository from where to remove the changes.\
3.  Select all the changed files (command + A)\
4.  Right click over the selected changes.\
5.  Select **discard selected changes** and click on OK.
