Each time a new entry is finish: Save, Rebuild, Commit and Push to update webpage. 1.2 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1.1 (\\@ref(intro) . If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4 (\\@ref(methods)). To reference chapters use the \\@ref(name of the chapter), keep in mind that the name of the chapter is the first line # title of the .Rmd file. Moreover, the back slash \\ character in the japanese keyboard is made with the keys Alt/Option + ¥ (¥ is next to the erase/back key). Interestingly \\ works fine in R but does not seems to work for Word or other MS office applications. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

When opening/starting a new mac for the first time always use the same account name and Home directory name. This will make the running of R code in either machine (folder and file locations) equal, and conflits or modification will be minimal.

(Simpler to fill and set) Account name: marcelorosales Full Name: Marcelo Rosales Home directory: /Users/marcelorosales 2.1 Install Homebrew Why to Install Homebrew? Homebrew is a terminal program that helps to easily Install, Update, Upgrade, and Automate many tasks in Mac computers. I used Mainly to migrate all my programs from one machine to another. Formulae and Cask are small code snippets that need to be copy/paste or type into Mac Terminal to install a program. An example of a “Cask formula”: brew install --cask inkscape You can search for the formulae and cask of a program in the homebrew webpage. At the end of the installation, I will make a list of all the essencial programs (and some of the program settings like R and Atom) I need in a computer, and whenever I need to set up a new machine; Then, I will not have to install all the programs one by one again. Install Homebrew. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uvr9-zUB3w. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VP2NVv3LHg. To Install Homebrew (on macOS or Linux) https://brew.sh/. /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&quot; More installation information and options: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation. If running Linux or WSL, there are some pre-requisite packages to install. To Uninstall Homebrew link here /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall.sh)&quot; Download the uninstall script and run /bin/bash uninstall.sh –help to view more uninstall options. Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t. brew install wget Update and upgrade, in brief, brew update updates Homebrew itself while brew upgrade will upgrade your Homebrew-installed software to their latest versions.Dec 2020: brew update brew upgrade In my 2021Y-01M-02D upgrade and update an error occurred. IF Error: homebrew-core is a shallow clone. To brew update, first run: git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow This restriction has been made on GitHub’s request because updating shallow clones is an extremely expensive operation due to the tree layout and traffic of Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask. We don’t do this for you automatically to avoid repeatedly performing an expensive unshallow operation in CI systems (which should instead be fixed to not use shallow clones). Sorry for the inconvenience! The run ( requires a long time to run ) Check if brew installed correctly with: brew doctor Usually it prompts Your system is ready to brew. In my macbook pro 2015: Warning: Homebrew’s sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed formulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin. Consider setting the PATH for example like… so run: echo &#39;export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/sbin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc Warning: Your Xcode (11.7) is outdated. Please update to Xcode 12.3 (or delete it). Xcode can be updated from the App Store. To check if a software/package is installed, and if not, then install brew list &lt;formulae1&gt; || brew install &lt;formulae1&gt; This will error on list and continue with install if not installed otherwise it will just list package files. (one could modify this further as a function or alias in .bashrc to make it easier to type) From the tutorial To confirm installation and to check install use the command. brew help To list all the packages that you can install with homebrew use the command. brew search A long list will be displayed. If you want to count the number of packages available, ‘search’ with ‘word count’ as a list with the command. brew search | wc -l To search for a specific package use the command, or the brew web page search engine here. brew search &lt;name of the package&gt; Ex. brew search postgres Results can be of two types: - Formulae which typically deals with command software and, - Cask is and extension of homebrew that allows us to install macOS native applications like google chrome, etc. To install packages with brew, first check if the package exist, type the name of the package, ex. tree command. If the package is not installed the message bash: tree: command not found will be displayed. To install the package (tree) use the command. brew install tree To see the path of the installed package (in this case tree), type in terminal. which &lt;pckg name&gt; ex. which tree Terminal will display /usr/local/bin/tree, which seem to be the path of the folder where the package was saved, but in reality is a symbolic link or symlink. To see the real location use the commands list and list-out and copy the symlink of the packege. ls -la /usr/local/bin/tree Terminal will display lrwxr-xr-x 1 Marcelo-Rosales admin 29 Jan 4 18:04 /usr/local/bin/tree -&gt; ../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree, where the last portion ../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree indicates the real location of the package. To see more information of the package, like the description, where and when was installed, etc. use the command. brew info tree If not installed it will also show the dependencies need for the installation. ex. brew info node. To uninstall a package. brew uninstall tree If you want to install GNU packages that are already install natively in and from macOS. It will not over-write over the original, instead it will add a g prefix in the name of the new package. To see the outdate packages that need an update use the command. brew outdated Then brew update and brew upgrade. However; by default, brew does not remove old version of a package. To remove this outdated version run the command. brew cleanup To install applications, use the command cask, ex. brew cask install firefox _Recently the &quot;cask&quot; command has been modify to &quot;--cask&quot;. From now on the command line would be like:_ brew install --cask firefox to see info or go directly to the home web page of the application use. brew info --cask firefox brew homepage --cask firefox To install packages from git repositories, we can tap the repository and then install the package. This packages Formulae or casks are usually not available in the brew search or web. So; 1st.: we have to pull the formulae or casks from the git repository with brew tap &lt;name of the repository&gt; Ex. brew tap heroku/brew 2nd.: Search in brew if the formulae or cask were saved.This will pull the Formulae needed to install. brew search heroku 3rd.: If present, then install as normal. brew install heroku 2.2 Brew Bundle and the “Brewfile”: Tips In brew Install “mas”, it lets you install and update application from the apple store. brew list mas || brew install mas or brew install mas Install the command “brew bundle”: With this package you can dump all the programs and applications that you installed with brew over time in a “brew file.” https://twit.tv/shows/hands-on-mac/episodes/9. brew bundle # or brew bundle install link here At first install (or if never done before) there is no brewfile and Error: No Brewfile found. To create a brew file run: brew bundle brew install bash-completions To see the # of packages available in brew. brew search To see the list of packages, [word count]- list brew search | wc -l To search a specific package. brew search [name of package] # Ex. brew search postgres Homebrew Tutorial video To install a package: brew install tree To see the path where brew saves the packages: which [name of package] Ex which tree Output answer in console: /usr/local/bin/tree. However, this is not the folder, this is just a symbolic link. To see the real location: ls -la [symbolic path] Ex. ls -la /usr/local/bin/tree Output answer in console: lrwxr-xr-x 1 marcelorosales admin 29 Dec 29 20:36 /usr/local/bin/tree -&gt; ../Cellar/tree/1.8.0/bin/tree This means that the location is in /usr/local/Cellar directory. For more info on the package, if is not installed it will show and also will show the dependencies it needs. brew info tree To uninstall a package brew uninstall tree To see the version of packages: grep --version If there is already a native package on the operating system, for instance macOS grep. Then the new package installed will have a “g” prefix. $% brew update brew outdated Brew upgrade brew clean up brew doctor To install Mac applications use the “cask” command. Example. $% brew cask install firefox To open the webpages of the application directly use $% brew home rstudio brew home r brew home pycharm [ ] hello 2.3 Using Scripts to Automate Installs (and save time in Install and setup) video link Homebrew must be installed. In homebrew, make sure that git is installed, also, that your Automated scripts are in your repository. To check in Terminal run git. git If it displays git commands, then git is install and ready to connect. &gt; &gt; "],["r-and-rstudio.html", "Chapter 3 R and Rstudio", " Chapter 3 R and Rstudio "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods", " Chapter 4 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
